# ECommerce Back End Livin

We learned to create an inventory manager via tools like MySql and Express and test them through Insomnia. Its amazing how simple it can look in the end and be easy to use as long as you put in the work to make it function correctly. Anyone who wants to keep track of inventory for sales online or just a store in general could easily use this program.

## Why did you build this?

- I built this program as a way for people to organize and manage date via tables in MySql and manage or view them using insomnia. It felt slightly tedious I will admit, but in the end it was extremely satisfying to see an end result that works properly and would be able to do the inventory for a person or company. I used to do that by hand and then manually write it down and give it to someone else to enter into a computer and it was one of the worst days at our business. Everyone dreaded "The Inventory Days"

- I learned more about routes and models and sql than I have on any other project or app I have collaborated on. I took much longer for me to finish than I would have liked but that ended up being a blessing because I feel that I know much more now than I would have if it had gone smoothly. You quickly begin to learn that errors are the best way to learn.

## Installation and testing

To install the program you would download the repository. Then you would use the following commands in your terminal in order for it to function properly.
-npm init
-npm install  (this should install your programs but you want to make sure you also install the following)
-npm install sequelize
-npm install dotenv

-Any testing can be done once the program is running via Insomnia.


## How do you use the program?

You would run the program by starting up MySql by typing in mysql -u root -p. You will then have a password that you will have created on MySql's website. Then if brand new you will Create the Database using "CREATE (name_db)".  Your dotenv file will contain this information as well. Then the command "USE (name_db)" it should show that your are now in the correct file. After that you will go back to your regular terminal but leave mysql open.  
At that point, if you have a pre-populated seed folder with your current inventory type "npm run seed". After thatt "npm start". And once that is complete you are off to the races!!  You should see that the program is now running on the designated port.  

### What language or programs did you use?

We used MySql/MySql2, Insomnia, Express, and Sequelize. The usual suspects are there as well with VS CODE and Javascript.

### Do you already have future plans for improvements?

I have been trying to think of ways to incorporate it into an existing site as I have multiple friends who sell things online but no REAL inventory system to speak of. I am going to love seeing if they want to use this and customize it in any way.

### What did you learn while building this?

I learned more about routes and models and mysql than I have on anything else so far. I had to turn it in late because I had a hard time but that ended up being a blessing because I feel that I know much more now than I would have if it had gone smoothly. Errors just become ways to learn.
